\section{Related Work}

A large amount of related work has focused on analysis in the Bitcoin network. 

Most of this has been about user privacy. Some approaches have involved analyzing and clustering transactions in the chain, for example determining which transactions were initiated by the same entity, determining whether movements of money are ``change'' back to oneself or actual movement of value between users. Other approaches have involved monitoring the Bitcoin network itself in order to correlate transactions to the IP address of the creator of the transaction\cite{}.
