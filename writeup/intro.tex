\section{Introduction}

The network topology is important to the security of the network. Since the \bc protocol does not explicitly include mechanism for topology discovery, this has so far been impossible to evaluate.

\paragraph{Our contributions.} Our contributions are the following:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item We propose novel \emph{network mapping} techniques for inferring the connection topology of Bitcoin nodes. We compare our techniques against prior approaches analytically and empirically, through both simulation and cross-validation in the live network.
\item We present the results of the network mapping scan of the live Bitcoin network, and show measurements and analysis of the estimated connection topology.
\item We present new denial-of-service attacks, as well as attacks that can \emph{alter} the network topology, amplifying further attacks.
\item We develop a simulator framework capable of running full-scale network simulations (i.e., close to 10k nodes) using the actual Bitcoin client source code.
\end{itemize}
